## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   `git`
*   `Node.js` (LTS version recommended)
*   `Python` (3.9+)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akkalatejaswaroop/IntelliForge-AI.git
    cd IntelliForge-AI
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend # Or the appropriate frontend directory
    npm install # Or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd ../backend # Or the appropriate backend directory
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (and potentially `frontend` for API endpoints) based on a `.env.example` file. This will typically include:
    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or other LLM provider keys)
    *   `DATABASE_URL`
    *   `SECRET_KEY` for authentication
    *   ...and other relevant environment variables.

    ```
    # Example .env content
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
    FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
    # ... other variables
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**

    *   **Start Frontend:**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm start # Or yarn start
        ```

    *   **Start Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd ../backend
        uvicorn main:app --reload # Or python app.py if using Flask/Django etc.
        ```

    The application should now be accessible in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üí° Usage Example

Once IntelliForge AI is running, its intuitive interface makes complex tasks simple.
